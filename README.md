# Python Codes to Data Cleaning, Transformation and Visualization

In this repository there's some codes writed by me.
The only porpouse is to show my skill to data cleaning, transformation and visualization using python.

There's is notebooks that I write only for studying porpouses, but there's notebooks that I just wanna show the code without any data, this is cause some of them I writed and used in my job and have private data.
